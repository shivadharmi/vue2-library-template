## Tech

Vue-Library-Template uses a number of open source packages to create a production ready vue library:

- [Typescript] - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- [Vue.js] - An approachable, performant and versatile framework for building web user interfaces.
- [vite.dev] - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [Eslint] - ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.    
- [Prettier] - An opinionated code formatter
- [Husky] - Husky improves your commits and more üê∂ woof!
- And many other plugins

And of course Vue-Library-Template itself is open source with a [public repository][VLT] on GitHub.
